Stripe CTF3
===========

Here are my answers to Stripe CTF3. I managed to get to (but not finish) level
three. After racing through the solutions for the first few levels I have spent
an inordinate amount of time with [jcslassi](github.com/jcslassi/stripe-ctf)
working on optimising our (vastly different) solutions to level 1.

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>LEVEL</th>
			<th>0</th>
			<th>1</th>
			<th>2</th>
			<th>3</th>
			<th>4</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>RANK</th>
			<td>10</td>
			<td>103</td>
			<td>531</td>
			<td>-</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>SCORE</th>
			<td>3524</td>
			<td>50</td>
			<td>120</td>
			<td>-</td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
